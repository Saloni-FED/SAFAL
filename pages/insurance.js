              <h3>What is Term Insurance ?</h3>
              <p>
                Imagine a world where you could potentially buy a product that
                could replace you. Okay, not you precisely, because that would
                be a bit silly. But what if you had a replica version of
                yourself that could earn like you and make money like you.
                Wouldn’t you jump on that opportunity? Or maybe pay an annual
                fee just so you could hold on to this person? You probably
                would. And a term insurance product does just that. It is your
                financial replica and it comes alive when you die.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let me explain. When you buy a term insurance product, you pay a
                small fee every year to protect your downside. And in the event
                of your passing, the insurance company pays out a large sum of
                money to your family or your loved ones. Think — 1 Crore or 5
                Crore or even 10 Crore. Ideally, this money should replace you
                financially. It should support your family when you’re no longer
                the breadwinner. And unless you’ve deliberately misled your
                insurer whilst buying the policy, they will pay out the full
                amount the moment you die. Hell, even if you do mislead them,
                they have 3 years to uncover the fraud. If they don’t do it by
                then, they are mandated to pay out, no questions asked. So
                unless you commit suicide within one year of buying the policy
                or you died while committing a crime, your loved ones will get
                this money.
              </p>
              <p>
                And while the base product is simple enough to understand, we’ll
                address some of the key factors affecting a term insurance
                purchase in the next section.
              </p>
              <h3>What is an ideal cover for your Term policy?</h3>
              <p>
                The first question should be obvious by now — How much money do
                you need to replace yourself financially?
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s a tough question and let’s be honest — It is a bit
                subjective as well. But there are a few key things you have to
                remember here. For starters, your expenses. If your lifestyle
                demands a certain level of spending you will need to keep it up
                if you don’t want your absence to be felt. So if you’re spending
                50,000 every month, your term insurance product should replace
                this income. And at that rate, you’re probably looking at a
                cover totalling 1 Crore. Let me explain why.
              </p>
              <p>
                Think about what your family would do if they received this
                money. Assume they do the least sophisticated thing possible —
                which is probably the smartest thing to do as well.
              </p>
              <h3>Fixed Deposits!</h3>
              <p>
                At 6% annually, they will receive 6 lakhs each year. That should
                adequately compensate for your lost income. However with
                inflation, that 6 lakhs might start looking paltry very soon. So
                let’s try and beat inflation. Let’s assume the insurer pays you
                2 Crores. That should get your family 12 lakhs each year. A
                pretty good sum overall and maybe good enough for the next 10
                years. But what if you have a lot of financial obligations?
                Loans and that sort of stuff.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then you should start looking at a higher cover. And while these
                are rough estimates, I hope you get where I am going with this.
                The final amount should generate enough cash flows for a
                reasonable amount of time to pay for all your family expenses
                (including EMIs) and also leave a little extra for your family.

                your ideal cover.

              <h3>What’s an ideal policy duration?</h3>
              <p>
                Remember. With a term insurance product, you keep paying your
                premiums until you die. Or the policy lapses. So there is an
                expiration date of sorts and it’s on you to decide how long you
                want to keep your policy. And you have to make this choice at
                the time of purchase. You can’t change it afterwards. So there’s
                a lot riding on this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once again, you are looking to replace yourself financially. But
                you are only doing it because — When you’re young, your family
                won’t have a lot of savings to fall back on. As you grow older,
                however, that changes. For instance, by 60, your kids will be
                all grown up. Your spouse will likely have a retirement fund to
                lean on and you won’t have many dependents to worry about.
              </p>
              <p>
                So 60 could be a good place to start. But the insurance company
                knows something. The average life expectancy in India is about
                70. So if you are intending to keep the policy beyond 70, know
                that your premiums will shoot up. Like a lot. And that means the
                sweet spot is somewhere between 60 and 70. Any number in that
                range should ideally serve you well.
              </p>

              <p>
                And while this overview should help you understand term
                insurance, there are a few add-ons aka riders you can attach
                alongside the base policy to make sure your financial
                replacement is as robust as you. And the most useful rider of
                them all is a life stage benefit.
              </p>

              <h3>Calculate Term Insurance Premium</h3>

              <Calculator />
              <h3>How does a Life Stage Benefit help you?</h3>
              <p>
                Term insurance policies are extremely rigid. You can’t change
                your coverage once you sign the deal. If it was 1 Crore six
                years back, it will be 1 Crore until the policy expires. So if
                you buy a policy when you’re young, your cover might be wholly
                inadequate in the future — when you marry and you have kids.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unless you opted for a life-stage benefit. In which case, the
                insurer will offer you the option to increase your cover by a
                certain amount during major life events. For instance, when you
                get married and you have kids. It’s this sort of flexibility
                that you need in a good term insurance policy. And so if you
                aren’t married yet, maybe you should consider this benefit. If
                you think you will have more dependants in the future, opting
                for a life stage benefit is a no-brainer.
              </p>
              <h3>When the Insurer waives your premiums</h3>
              <p>
                Imagine one day, the doctors tell you that you will be confined
                to a wheelchair permanently. It’ll be devastating, I know. You
                will have to quit your job. You will have to figure out a way to
                make a living despite your condition and in the meantime, you
                will have to relook at your investments, prune your spending and
                maybe even drop your term insurance policy.
              </p>

              <p>
                {" "}
                How are you going to pay 15,000 every year in premiums, eh?
              </p>
              <p>
                That money could come in handy elsewhere. But what if it didn’t
                have to be this way? What if the insurer allowed you to keep the
                policy even without paying your premium. See… Your condition is
                unique. You would have persisted with the policy if you hadn’t
                been disabled. So some insurers will allow you to opt for a
                waiver. That’s them telling you — Pay a small fee and you won’t
                have to worry about your premiums in the event you are disabled.
                You can still keep your policy!!!
              </p>
              <p>
                And while the waiver I just described kicks in if you are
                permanently disabled, you could also opt for a waiver if you are
                diagnosed with a critical illness — like Cancer. A waiver of
                premiums might not sound like much. But if you are permanently
                disabled or if you are forced to quit your job because of a
                critical illness, this benefit could be a lifesaver. So maybe
                you should actively consider both riders.
              </p>

              <h3>Extra cover if you die in an accident?</h3>
              <p>
                We have lax enforcement of traffic laws. We have terrible roads
                and poor street lights. We have reckless drivers and speeding
                motorists. And as a result, there’s a fatal accident in this
                country every 4 minutes. And if you’re worried about this
                statistic maybe it makes sense to opt for an accidental cover.
                In which case, the insurer pays out an additional 1 Crore to the
                family on top of the term cover (2 Cr.)
              </p>

              <p>
                if you died in an accident. And while these numbers are for
                illustrative purposes only, you can see how it can add an extra
                layer of security for your dependents, no? If you pay a little
                bit extra alongside your base premium, your family could get
                some extra money and some extra protection in the event you die
                from an accident. But having said that, you must never reduce
                your term cover just because you have some protection here. That
                is a bad idea.
              </p>

              <h3>How a Critical Illness Benefit can help you?</h3>
              <p>
                Critical illnesses like cancer are hard to deal with. Granted,
                your medical bills will be taken care of if you have an
                extremely comprehensive health insurance policy. But once
                diagnosed with a debilitating disease, you’ll be forced to take
                a break. You won’t be able to go to work. And your family will
                have to make do without your income.
              </p>
              <p>
                But if you opt for a critical illness benefit, things won’t have
                to be this grim. In the event, you are diagnosed with a critical
                illness, the insurer will pay out a portion of your term cover
                in cash to help you tide this crisis. It could be 10 lakhs. It
                could be 50 lakhs. It could be 1 Crore. All you have to do is
                choose the amount when opting for the benefit and you can use
                this money to replace your lost income if you are ever diagnosed
                with a critical illness. A critical illness rider will make your
                life so much easier. But remember — most policies will pay out
                the corpus from your sum insured. And your term cover will
                reduce by an equal amount.
              </p>

              <h3>Should you opt for a Terminal Illness Benefit?</h3>

              <p>
                The last thing you want to do with a terminal illness is — give
                up. When the doctor says you’ve got 6 months to live, you don’t
                begin counting your days. Instead, you look for avenues to
                survive. You’d want to avail the best treatment in town. Maybe
                even go abroad. The only problem — It costs money. A lot of it.
              </p>
              <p>
                And if you opt for a terminal illness benefit, maybe you’d have
                a recourse. See, some insurers will offer you the entire cover
                in cold hard cash the moment you’re diagnosed with a terminal
                illness. That’s them telling you — “You’re good as dead. So take
                the money.” And with the large lump sum amount, maybe you’ll
                have a chance to avail the best treatment doctors can offer you.
                And guess what? Even if you make it through and live past 6
                months, the insurer won’t ask you to pay them back. While this
                seems like a nice benefit to have, the likelihood of a doctor
                certifying a terminal illness and the insurer accepting the
                assessment isn’t all that high. So maybe you should consider
                this fact before opting for this particular rider.
              </p>
              <h3>Can you beat inflation with increasing Cover?</h3>
              <p>
                Term Insurance is weird. You pick a number — your total cover.
                The insurer promises to provide the said cover in case you die.
                And in return, you continue paying a premium every single year
                until that day comes. Or your paying term concludes. And while
                there is nothing peculiar about this arrangement in itself,
                think about the implications of your decision 15 years from now.
                A one crore cover might look paltry if you haven’t taken
                inflation into account.
              </p>
              <p>
                Which is why most people decide on the sum insured assuming
                inflation will continue to make ground each year.
              </p>
              <p>
                But what if you didn’t have to worry about all this while
                picking a cover. What if your sum insured grew by 5% or 10% each
                year? That would save you a whole lot of trouble. However,
                premiums for these plans are going to be much higher than your
                usual straight forward term insurance. After all, there is no
                free lunch in this world. So if you are looking to buy a term
                policy with an increasing cover each year, remember your
                premiums are 50 to 60 % higher as well. So it does make sense to
                take into account for inflation beforehand which we do help out
                with.
              </p>
              <p>
                You could opt for this benefit or you could simply do the
                calculation right now and pick a larger cover that will protect
                against inflation. It’s on you really.
              </p>

              <h3>Should you decrease your cover as you grow older?</h3>
              <p>
                Remember how I introduced term insurance as a product to replace
                you financially? Yeah, we need to revisit that. See, as you grow
                older, your dependents may no longer be as dependent on you as
                they once were. Your kids grow up. Your savings corpus increase
                in value. You will have enough money to cushion against any
                headwind. More importantly, your financial obligations will no
                longer look insurmountable.

                Think about it. If you’re a young lady with a home loan, you
                have to worry about paying your EMI each month. And in the off
                chance, you pass away, the burden shifts — to your spouse or
                even worse, your kids. So obviously you need better protection.
                You need a higher cover. But once you are through with the EMIs
                and your kids start working, maybe you won’t need the same level
                of protection. Maybe replacing you financially won’t be that big
                of a challenge. So some insurance companies offer you the option
                of decreasing your cover as you grow older. And that obviously
                means you will have also have to pay lower premiums as your
                cover diminishes in value.

                While this might be a feature some people would seek, it’s very
                hard to predict future financial obligations. So if you are
                opting for this rider, make sure you are doubly sure you won’t
                need a massive cover as you grow older. Don't forget to share
