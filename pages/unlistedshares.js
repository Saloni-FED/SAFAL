            <h3>What is Term Unlisted Shares?</h3>
            <p>
              Unlisted shares refer to the equity shares of a company that are
              not listed on any recognized stock exchange. This means that they
              cannot be freely traded on public markets like the shares of
              publicly listed companies. These shares are typically issued by
              private companies, which can include startups, small and
              medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), or family-owned businesses.
              Unlike listed shares that are bought and sold through stock
              exchanges, unlisted shares are traded through private
              transactions. This can occur via over-the-counter (OTC) markets,
              private placements, or direct negotiations between buyers and
              sellers.
            </p>
            <h3>Benfits of Unlisted Shares</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Investing in unlisted shares, especially in early-stage
                companies or startups, can potentially yield significant returns
                if the company grows and eventually goes public or is acquired.
              </li>
              <li>
                Investors can access companies and opportunities that are not
                available on public stock exchanges, often in niche or emerging
                industries.
              </li>
              <li>
                Investors in unlisted shares, such as venture capitalists or
                private equity firms, often have a greater say in the company’s
                management and strategic direction.
              </li>

                        Investing in unlisted shares comes with several risks,
                        including low liquidity, valuation uncertainty, and less
                        regulatory oversight compared to listed shares. It's
                        important to conduct thorough due diligence before
                        investing.

                        Unlisted shares offer the potential for high returns,
                        especially if the company grows and eventually goes
                        public or is acquired. They also provide access to
                        unique investment opportunities not available on public

                        brokers who specialize in unlisted securities. The
                        process can be more time-consuming compared to selling
                        listed shares.

                        The valuation of unlisted shares is not determined by

                        and independent appraisals. This can lead to subjective

                        Unlisted shares are subject to different regulatory
                        standards compared to listed shares. Companies issuing
                        unlisted shares have fewer disclosure requirements,
                        resulting in less transparency for investors. It is
                        essential to understand the legal framework and
                        compliance requirements in your jurisdiction.
